# Launch Frets on Fire via i.e. Ubuntu?

## 2011-03-23 09:23:14, posted by: Meluxe

Hello there,  
   
 i am wondering if it would be possible to start Frets on fire(fof) via Ubuntu or if there are needed changes in the code of fof (or any other app) to run it, besides of changes in xell relating to controller input and sound, of course.  
 I would try that out but have some issues with my Provider and therefore a limited access ^^   
   
 Thanks for reading !

i think fretsonfire needs 3d acceleration and we dont even have 2d accelerated drivers yet.
