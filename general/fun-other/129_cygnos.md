Just wondering if anyone has a Cygnos v2 chip, and if it's worth the money. Having two NAND chips seems like it would have a lot of cool possibilities. I know you can't have both chips be homebrew kernels? Can you have just XeLL on one kernel, and FreeeBOOT on the mainboard? Just seems really cool to me ^^ I know they're a pain to install, but if the pro's outweigh the cons I may get one ^^  
   
 If anyone has any info, please feel free to let me know if the Cygnos v2 chip is worth it :)

 You need revision E iirc. This is the version with Dual NAND! Revision F has no second NAND anymore. Not sure about the revision so you want to verify that before you buy the chip!

Thanks tux, wasn't sure on the specifics of the chip :P Thanks for the info. I am considering getting a dual NAND revision so that I will always have a working NAND and a NAND that I can experiment and test with. Specifically when we start working to put Linux on the NAND ;)
