I checked my spam folder, and there was nothing form the site in there. I am subscribed to a few threads but never get email updates when replies are made. I would very much appreciator it if this could be fixed soon. Thanks in advance!

Yep, was it something server side or personal profile settings?

Thank you for the prompt fix! Now I can reply more promptly and, hopefully, get my box finally configured in a proper working state. :)
