Hey everybody.   
   
 After a while of downtime we are back.   
   
 There were some annoying problems with the domain ownership... Somebody (alright, alright, it was me) forgot to renew it.   
   
 But now everything is solved and we are happy to be back :D  
   
 Apologies for the inconvenience.

Hi. I want to thank all of you involved in this project. You made a great work porting Linux on the Xbox 360. Now I have instaled Ubuntu 11.10 on my Xbox 360 Slim (Trinity).
