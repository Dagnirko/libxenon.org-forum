Some of you may have noticed the following addresses have been down for the last day or two [list] - [*]free60.org
 - [*]libxenon.org
 - [*]file.libxenon.org
[/list] I am here to inform you that the server migration has been a success, and that pending dns updates all services have been restored.

Damn.....I didnt even know there were any problems with the servers although I have been away for a bit.....  
   
 I know its off topic and I probly shouldnt even say anything but I have been fighting withdraws from suboxone. For anyone who doesnt know what it is its pretty much the alternative to methodone....so yea. Yea I was that guy that everyone knows was a pill head(perc, vics, oxys). Now I am trying to come off the sub to be completey clean and it has been the worst week of my life.   
   
 I know this isnt the place but I had to say something to somebody, you know its like a community over here. I am sure atleast one of you understand just what I am going through now. Anyways I have probly said too damn much, I cant even type right now.
