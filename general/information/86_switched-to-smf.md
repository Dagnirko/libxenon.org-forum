Hi Tux,  
   
 Using BETA 5 to type this 8). It is really fast using USB, infact boot speed seems about 20-30% faster than when I installed Debian LXDE, but then I do have a fast USB stick which helps.  
   
 Anyway, I ran uname -r and noted BETA 5 comes with the kernel compile 2.6.36.2-xenon. I checked the thread and I can see you mentioning trying Test2 of 2.6.36.4 but the link seems to have gone. Could you re up this please?  
   
 Many thanks, Chris.
