I like to believe that it will be possible, looking at the Specs of the PS2, a single core 300MHz processer 32mb of ram, and a graphics processing unit that runs at 150MHz  
   
 The Xbox360 has a Tri core processor with HyperThreading "Six core virtual running at 3.2GHz"   
 It also has a 500MHz Graphics processing unit, with 512MB of shared GDDR3 RAM.  
   
 although I know and you all should know that clock speed doesn't make the processor, in this case I'm speaking for the Graphics chip's, but with optimization and good coding, i believe there could be a successful emulator of the PS2 on the Xbox360, but i believe Xell only has limited accessibility of the Graphics chip, so it would be best if it were programed to be run as an XEX, instead of an ELf.  
   
 Come at me bro.

 your misuse of the word Moron is amusing, but i still wonder why kids such as yourself like to use it, well, every kid that i know that overly and continually use that word with no knowledge of it's definition plays Call of Duty, so i could imagine it has something to do with the cod fags.  
   
 Anyhow, both of our reply's are off topic, so go away noob.

Please remain on topic. By the way i would like to see ps2 emulator for libxenon, but i doubt that xbox 360 could run it 100% acuracy, specially on those heavy games.   
   
 Other toughts.. i think it could have the ability to emulate nintendo DS with full speed.. We'll have to wait to see..
