No Flash Controller means your USB/LPT connection cannot see the console. Make sure it's plugged in but not switched on.

yeah it was fine until i flashed image\_00000000.ecc to it . Obviously it was working ok then . I`ve done over 100 normal jtags with my nand-x so i know how to use it and install the wiring and wot not . It`s just that now i`ve flashed the image\_00000000.ecc it`s not finding the flash controller  
   
 Wiring is ok , console plugged in , not on , nand-x showing red and yellow . Tried pressing the nand-x reset button . nadda .   
   
 can I use xell to flash the freeboot image via usb with the reset glitch hack ?
