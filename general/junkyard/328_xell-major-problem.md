Hi! I have a serous problem with Xell Reloaded. It boots, but that is about it. It gets to the end of the info about the USB Ports and then it gets stuck. I need it so that i can get my CPU Key so i can install the RGLoader build. I DO NOT have my JTAG's original Nand as i bought it off a guy on TTG. This is really bugging me because i have no idea what is wrong with it. Xell has booted successfully while i have had my JTAG for atleast 3 times. It just get's stuck now. Please reply quickly!

cant you boot from the eject button? also check if you're using the xell launcher provided with your dash launch version
