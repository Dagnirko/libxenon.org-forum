# Using a Phat sidecar on slim?

## 2012-09-23 07:25:18, posted by: superspeed

I have a proto Slim and am wanting to install the sidecar to it to use it on the slim. I don't really care to get the HDD running because I have the 250gb proto hdd already on it just wanting to run the PIX port and DVD Emu functions.
