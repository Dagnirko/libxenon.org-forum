# Starting Xell from NXE (catalog games)

## 2012-01-01 13:13:47, posted by: AddyMc

I kindly ask if someone can tell me how to start from Xell NXE? Because I downloaded the file and I get the icon (free60) games in the catalog but when I boot back to the dashboard without doing anything. The downloaded file tells me to copy the files into the same directory XexMenu: Content - 0000000000000000 - C0DE9999 - 00008000  
 Thanks in advance
