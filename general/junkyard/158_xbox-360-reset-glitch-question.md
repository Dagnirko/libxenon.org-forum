 I was reading the technical explation about it. They was able to encrypt a code to dump the cpu keyand decrpt the cd or cb\_b. Would it be possible to make a code to dump the rsa sign or what ever they call it .

I'm not really sure what you're asking here.. But if you're talking about the private content signing key.. The answer is no.  
   
 Also, topic locked.. Not the right place to be asking about this.
