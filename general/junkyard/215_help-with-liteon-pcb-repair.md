# Help with LiteOn PCB repair?

## 2011-10-26 23:11:09, posted by: madhartigan

I damaged my LiteOn DVD PCB a while back when I attempted to do the MRA hack.  
   
 I'd like to get it back into working order and my guess is that it's an easy fix. My problem is, I don't know what to do for the fix.  
   
 I found this diagram that's supposed to be for the Lite-On DVD "Fix" points.

 Here are some pictures of the damaged PCB:

 Hopefully someone can help me make sense of that "Alternate FIX points" diagram and I can get my LiteOn working.  
   
   
 Thanks!!

Find a nice level surface to place your soldering iron on.  
   
 Put it down in it's holder.  
   
 Turn it off.  
   
 Walk away.  
   
 :D  
   
 I've seen a LOT worse, but I really think you are better off getting somebody else to patch that up for you, before you damage it further.  
   
 EDIT: This is also libxenon.org, not really the right place for such things.

 Thank you for the response.  
   
 Close thread. (didn't realize these questions couldn't be asked here. sorry 'bout that.)
