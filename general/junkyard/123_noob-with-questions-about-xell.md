# Noob with questions about Xell

## 2011-07-05 21:14:03, posted by: Russtavo

Folks complete noob here, appreciate your patience. I have a JTAG Xenon - which was on dash 12611 - when I pressed eject it used to boot in Xellous 1.0. Lately, I used Coolshrimp's JTAG Tool to update to freeBOOT 13146. I also installed DashLaunch 2.22.   
   
 Everything was fine except now pressing eject presents a blank screen. To be honest I find the whole Xell/Xellous/Reloaded scene confusing, I'm not sure if I need any of it but it seems useful to have?  
   
 Anyway, when I built the freeBOOT image there were 2 "FreeBoot Eject" options: [list] - [*]Xell(HDMI)
 - [*]Xellous
[/list] I left it at the default (Xell HDMI) which may have been a mistake as my console is component video only. What's my best course of action, i.e. what do I install now and how? Do I need to reflash or not? I noticed there is a release for something called "[url=http://www.xbins.org/nfo.php?file=xboxnfo2081.nfo]XeLL Updater for freeBOOT - v1.1[/url]" - is this needed some way?  
   
 Confused please help!! :-\

Sorry to tell you but rebooters are NOT supported here.  
 Hint: XeLL Updater + XeLLous
