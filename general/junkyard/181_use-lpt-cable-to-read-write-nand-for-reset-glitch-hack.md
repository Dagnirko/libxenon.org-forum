# Use LPT Cable To Read/Write NAND For Reset Glitch Hack?

## 2011-09-22 22:35:01, posted by: Kangaru

I have been reading tutorials, and they all say to use a USB SPI programmer to read/write NAND. However, I still have my LPT NAND reader from when I JTAG'd my XBox 360. So I was just wondering if I could just use the LPT cable (even though I have no clue why I wouldn't be able to...).  
   
 Thanks,  
 Kangaru~  
   
 Edit: Are there any rebooters that can be used as of now?

Rebooter talk is not allowed. But you can use your lpt cable to flash the NAND.
