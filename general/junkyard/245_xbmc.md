SDL is ported by Lantus, so its about time to start working on XBMC :P ;D

Sweet! Keep us updated how that's going! You have it building yet? link to a repo?

I recall when the cygnos first came out there was a video where they had xbmc compiled in ppc linux (ubuntu, iirc). Can't wait to see any progress!  
   
 *edit* actually, I think the hurdle at the time was not waiting for SDL, but rather that there was no OpenGL 2.0, which is something xbmc is heavily based upon. Has any of this changed?

Sorry to disappoint you, but there is no real progress, just research.  
   
 And invitation for the people with knowledge to start thinking about possibility of such port.  
   
 I will also try to talk with XBMC developers about any help they can provide (no huge hopes here).  
   
 Kind Regards
