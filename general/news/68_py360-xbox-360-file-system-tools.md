## 2011-04-20 16:07:24, posted by: tuxuser

The Coder Arkem released nice tools, written in python, for the xbox360  
 [quote] I'm releasing the code and docs that I wrote during my Xbox 360 research.  
   
 py360 is a FUSE filesystem driver and associated file parsers for reading Xbox 360 hard drives. It is designed to aid forensic examination of the Xbox 360. The main components are a FUSE file system for mounting the XTAF file system and a set of python classes for parsing the the STFS, XDBF and Account block file formats and the XTAF file system.  
   
 py360 is available from [url=https://github.com/arkem/py360]github[/url] and I've written a [url=http://www.arkem.org/py360-user-guide.pdf]brief user guide[/url].  
   
 Additionally the results of my look into these [url=http://www.arkem.org/xbox360-file-reference.pdf]data structures is available[/url].  
   
 This project would not have been possible without the existing work of the [url=http://free60.org/Main\_Page]Free60 project[/url]. [/quote] Source: [url=http://memeover.arkem.org]http://memeover.arkem.org[/url]

Ui, a way to access hdd: plus all the stuff through Xell?  
   
 edit: that`s for Unix/PC, right?  
   
 edit: I see, with a python 2.6 interpreter and hdd: access plus a storage( don`t know if memory would be enough) we could run that even on the Box.  
 Seems like that is completely not the point but anyways helpful to understand the hdd ! :)
