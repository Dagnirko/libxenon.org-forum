Hello,  
   
 I have the same problem. The file browser doesnt seem to display any files (but something is there since if i click around enough, it tries to load casper/vmlinuz as a rom :) I have a widescreen standard def CRT hooked up with component leads and I figured this may be the problem? Is there any option in the .ini file to fix this? I tried changing a few values with no luck.  
   
 Kindest Regards.

Hi, no I burnt it to a DVD. Does it need a roms folder, or just all the files without the roms named folder? cheers
