# Replace x360 os/loader completely?

## 2014-04-22 19:36:44, posted by: intel352

I'd like to completely replace my x360 os & loader completely, to use it solely as a Linux machine. When I say completely, I mean I don't want to have to use some hack/mod to install linux as homebrew. I'd like to have a linux install that doesn't require any special launcher (or pressing DVD Eject button) before it can load.  
   
 Is this possible with the xbox 360 currently?
