I'm a little busy with my new work but every info is welcome i'm not that kind of a expert but if you don't try it you don't know if you can   
 can extend this into a livecd with grapics and have also a hdd image of it   
   
 and i could setup a binhost so that the packages we need to adjust   
   
 are precompiled so that we do'nt need to patch things afterwards to make it more easier for other people
