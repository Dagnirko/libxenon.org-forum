xf86-video-xenosfb (based on xf86-video-fbdev 0.4.2) [experimental]  
   
 http://file.libxenon.org/xf86-video-xenosfb-0.0.5.tar.gz  
   
 XenosFb is pretty easy to compile: Install xorg-dev and build-essential (apt-get or whatever), download the tarball, extract and then ./configure; make;  
 After that the driver is located at src/.libs/xenosfb\_drv.so .. copy it to /usr/lib/xorg/modules/drivers/ and test :)
