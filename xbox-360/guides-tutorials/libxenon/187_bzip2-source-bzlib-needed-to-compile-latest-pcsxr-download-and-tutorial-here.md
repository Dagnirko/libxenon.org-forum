Hey! Thought I'd help out anyone who wants to compile the latest version of pcsxr-xenon by Ced2911.  
   
 Download bzip2-1.0.6-xenon.zip (attached to this post), use your terminal to cd into the folder where you extracted it and type: [code]make && make install[/code] in order to install it!  
   
 After you've done this, pcsxr-xenon should compile fine.
