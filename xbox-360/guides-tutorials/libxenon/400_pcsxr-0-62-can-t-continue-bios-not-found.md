# pcsxr 0.62 Can't continue...bios not found...

## 2013-04-24 15:32:04, posted by: Captainwhizfiz

I get this stupid message every time i try to boot up a rom. I have 0 experience in anything about modding, hacking, glitching, whatever. I put the emulator on my thumb drive, I made a roms folder and put castlevania symphony of the night in it. The rom i downloaded came with a .cue version, and a .bin version. Every time i select one of them it says "Can't continue... bios not found..." But it came with 2 bios and i downloaded like 15 more bios and they are in the bios folder so what the heck is going on? If you can help, try to explain clearly, slowly and with not alot of fancy talk ok? I'm a noob. :P thanks
