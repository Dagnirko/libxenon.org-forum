# LibXenon Examples

## 2011-06-20 20:22:39, posted by: UNIX

Hey everyone,  
   
 I set up a public git repository specifically for LibXenon homebrew! I plan to start posting there a lot of sample code that the community can learn from and use. I will be posting a large chunk of all my code, with good documentation within the code so it is easy to understand, easy to read, and easy to understand what everything does.  
   
 The address for my github is:  
 [url=https://github.com/IUNIXI/Xbox-360-Homebrew]https://github.com/IUNIXI/Xbox-360-Homebrew[/url]  
   
 **[b]How do I get sources from the repository[/b]**  
   
 Simply run the command: [code]* *git clone https://github.com/IUNIXI/Xbox-360-Homebrew [/code] That will clone all of the contents of the repository to a folder called Xbox-360-Repository in whatever directory you ran the command from. If you want to clone an individual project, then simply run:  
 [code]* *git clone https://github.com/IUNIXI/Xbox-360-Homebrew/PROJECT-TO-CLONE [/code] Enjoy, and happy researching! :D  
   
 **[b]The Free60 GIT on github[/b]**

 **[b]More Examples[/b]**  
 For further examples have a look in our [url=http://libxenon.org/http://libxenon.org//viewforum.php?f=3.0]LibXenon-Download Section[/url] which includes Source Code for many LibXenon applications.

Added in SDL example, as well as a DebugLogging example. The DebugLogging example shows you how to log debugging information to a file on your USB storage device.
