All I get is index.php  
   
 EDIT: strange, it's fine in chrome and opera, only having the issue in firefox.

Thanks a lot for this tutorial! This was really helpful to me since I was stuck on this also. The software is pretty new to me, so I am pretty overwhelmed as it is. I was wondering if anyone would happen to know if there is a way to optimize my x-box for my [url=http://www.hhgregg.com/tvs/cat/lcd]LCD HDTV[/url], aside from the typical setting controls that are available from within the UI? I am tying to squeeze the sharpest clearest picture out of it, so any suggestions you might have would be very helpful.
