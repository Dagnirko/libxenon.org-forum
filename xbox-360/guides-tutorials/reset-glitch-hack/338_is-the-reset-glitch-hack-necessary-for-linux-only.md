# Is the Reset Glitch Hack Necessary for Linux Only?

## 2012-07-21 08:54:35, posted by: scott29347

Although I have a technical background, I am very new to this topic. So I apologize in advance if my question has been answered somewhere else. Most of the information on the net is very outdated. I only want to run Linux on my Xbox; I do not want to run any of the Xbox games, consol, etc.  
   
 I read that there is a way to completely replace the Xbox's stock BIOS with a "Cromwell" BIOS, but there does not seem to be any recent information. I get the sense that the Reset Glitch Hack is intended to allow the Xbox to run unsigned code along with the MS programs.  
   
 Do I need to do the Reset Glitch Hack to modify my Xbox to run just Linux? Can I flash the BIOS without having to do a hardware modification if my intention is not to run any MS products? My Xbox was manufactured in 2008 and the dashboard version is 2.0.13146.0.  
   
 Thanks.
