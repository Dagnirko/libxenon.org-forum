# Linux Mint Debian Edition on 360

## 2011-02-19 18:27:26, posted by: Cancerous1

**[b]Updated and should be working as of May 6th 2011[/b]**  
   
 Hello, I've modified the Debian 6 install script to install Mint on the 360  
   
 First you'll want to boot one of the Live CD's for the 360 through xell.  
 I used this one [url=http://downloads.sourceforge.net/free60/gentoo-livecd-xenon-beta-v2.iso]Gentoo-livecd[/url]  
   
 open a terminal  
 then type: [code]* *sudo su [enter] passwd [enter] (here you'll enter a password) wget http://file.libxenon.org/free60/linux/script/squeeze-mint-install.sh [enter] sh squeeze-mint-install.sh [enter] [/code] and that's all it takes to get started, the script should instruct you if it needs any input, which i tried to make as minimal as possible. It will install Debian Squeeze, then optionally you can install MintPPC from [url=http://mintppc.org/]MintPPC.org[/url] on top of it enjoy!  
   
 [attach=2] here is a kernel targeting the hdd once it is installed *9/5/2011  
   
 *If you choose, you can optionally skip the Mint part of the install and just use Squeeze, I built this script off of Tuxuser's squeeze-install script with some changes.  
 **You may also have to choose mint-lxde from the sessions at the login screen, your first login.  
   
 *** I'm also attaching these scripts to this post in case the ones Tux is nice enough to be hosting get out of date, you can edit them and still use them to install from your own hosting, or for those curious to see what i did in them.  
   
 ****modified scripts on server, and attached versions to always get current debootstrap image, please test :)

for some unknown reason debootstrap\_1.0.27\_all.deb has been removed, debootstrap\_1.0.28\_all.deb works. Scripts need updating or it will fail.  
   
 Chris.

thanks, the script is updated

Ok, got XBMC installed but I will warn that **[b]*it's not yet working for me*[/b]**  
   
 but anyone following along all the Squeeze/Mint testing perhaps someone can have better luck and share some experience.  
   
 edit /etc/apt/sources.list  
 add these two lines  
 [code]* *deb http://www.debian-multimedia.org squeeze main non-free deb-src http://www.debian-multimedia.org sid main [/code] then run these commands from a terminal [code]* *sudo apt-get install debian-multimedia-keyring sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install xbmc [/code] you'll then find XBMC under audio/video in the menu, good luck and please share back if you find a method to make it usable.

Hi,  
   
 If we cr√©ate two partition on an USB HDD (one swap and one ext3) can we install debian on USB HDD ?  
   
 I know we have to modify the install script but is it possible ?

## 2011-03-19 16:27:06, posted by: Cancerous1

sure sounds plausible, let people know how that goes.

## 2011-03-20 20:12:55, posted by: val532

I have been having some issues. For some reason I could no longer load it off of my HDD. So I decided to reinstall it and for some reason this is happening.

## 2011-04-12 18:42:11, posted by: Cancerous1

sounds like that debootstrap image link is not good anymore, maybe there is a new version or that mirror is down. Might have to google that filename and see if there's news of a newer one.  
   
 some people had problems installing also from the mirrors i chose in the script that were good for my location, but when they changed it to a local mirror it cleared things up

## 2011-05-06 07:39:02, posted by: Cancerous1

The scripts have been updated, and should be working (again), it's nothing magical or secret I'm attaching them to the first post in this thread in case anything changes (again) and the one's Tux is hosting for us get out of date. That way anyone interested in installing Mint/Squeeze this way can edit them without needing to wait for me to do it.

Dear friends. I need help. I want to install Debian on my Xbox 360, but I don't have a PC. I have two USB modems, Huawei E1750, Huawei E160e. Maybe somebody know how to mount one of them in Gentoo Live CD, so I could install Debian from the internet?

Can someone post a working link for the Xell-Bootloader-sda2. I've been googling for about an hour now and no luck. Thanks

I just updated my Xell to xell-Reloaded...and installed "mint debian" througt the "Ubuntu LiveCd Beta5"  
 but everytime when i try to load "vmlinux-nospinlock-sda2.tar.gz" from USB i get Kernel panic.... 

## 2011-07-10 00:29:31, posted by: tuxuser

Did you follow the output while install-script execution? Any errors? What's the kernel panic saying exactly?   
   
 check via LiveCD whats the output of   
 [code]* *fdisk -l [/code] ?

You didnt follow the install-script execution: Your system wasnt installed properly, thats why you get the kernel panic.

## 2011-07-11 13:14:21, posted by: Doerek

after this..  
 [code]* *sudo su [enter] passwd [enter] (here you'll enter a password) wget http://file.libxenon.org/free60/linux/script/squeeze-mint-install.sh [enter] sh squeeze-mint-install.sh [enter] [/code] it says that i must continue using the Xell-Bootloader.

## 2011-07-11 13:35:40, posted by: Doerek

This is what happens when i run the "squeeze-mint-install.sh"  
 It seams that there are some files not found, like "deboostrap\_1.0.30\_all.deb"  
 And on Line 20 the command "ar" is not found (probably "tar"?)  
 here is a screenshot:

Doerek, i attached the scripts to the first post so you can download them and edit it as these debootstrap images go out of date, tbh I don't know how to make it always get the current one or I'd edit the script to do that. If you follow the thread this exact problem has happened before. It should go smooth for you after you fix the link for that file, lets hope.

Chroot into debian from a liveCD (either Gentoo or Ubuntu, use what you like)  
   
 then do:  
 [code]* *cd /dev mknod -m 622 console c 5 1 mknod -m 622 tty0 c 4 0 [/code]

 After Chroot into debian i selected (2)  
 "Stop here and use Squeeze"  
 but after fetching some files it promt me to restart.  
 should it select option (1) and try to install "mint" ?

## 2011-08-24 06:00:00, posted by: Cancerous1

perhaps there was an error earlier in the install you may not have noticed. Mount debian from a livecd chroot into it again and check the home folder for an error log.

So after the first step i boot the XeLL Sda iso? and then do i run the mint script and how would i run the mint script ? Sorry I am bad at this type of stuff.

a lot of the dependencies are missing from ftp://mirrors.kernel.org/debian/  
 everything from Mawk on fails to download.

## 2011-12-22 00:59:10, posted by: Cancerous1

I didn't have that problem when I test 1 month ago, although I guess I could install again to be sure the problem wasn't on your end. Unless you can suggest a fix?

## 2011-12-22 01:15:07, posted by: Grim187

im pretty sure the mawk files should be here; ftp://mirrors.kernel.org/debian/pool/main/m/mawk/  
   
 i think the files its failing to download are just missing from the server.

 now hElp me out here guys i've tried this debian mint, ubuntu 11.10, debian etch, etc. etc. and whatnot... i can't get them to work, it seems the debians are short on debootstrap links it doesn't work in any debian script(?) while the ubuntu 11.10 posted here did work for me (or seem to, all the downloads were working including the debootsrap links, but i have no idea how to boot it? is it with the xeLL bootloader-sda2-v2.6.24.3.tar.gz CD? when i boot with it it says 'cannot open root device "sda2" or unknown-block(8,2) please append a correct "root=" boot option; here are the available partition; 0b00 1048575 sr0 driver: sr. 0000 312571224 sda driver: sd'.. and when i 'fdisk -l' this ubuntu 11.10 from the livecd it says the partitions r not good (i can't remember the exact words) while the debians when i do the 'fdisk -l' the partitions seem fine, but as i said the debootstrap links don't work and from there on the script doesn't work and when i try to boot the debians with the xeLL bootloader-sda2-v2.6.24.3.tar.gz CD the Kernel panics :P so how do i get this Linux into my xbox 360 rgh 320gb hd? what am i doing wrong? please help. thanks. and btw excellent work and your signature is hilarious as hell! ;D and great work cancerous as well so if you guys can help please would b greatly appreciated thanks in advance!
