# Small SDL Progress

Hey guys,  
   
 Been working a bit with SDL today now that I have it set up properly. I don't really have much to show yet, but some progress. I can initialize SDL surfaces, but so far I cannot write anything to them. I have been trying to render an image, but all that shows up is black/white stripes where the image should be displayed.

 The stripes are where the image should be, and where I have started the surface.   
   
 Anyway, just wanted to show i have SDL somewhat working :P I think the stripes issue could have to do with edram initialization.. Don't know, feel free to suggest options ;)
