# SDL Example

## 2011-07-04 23:28:10, posted by: UNIX

Hey guys,  
   
 I have been working with SDL these past few days and I finally worked out the speed issue and am able to display graphic loops now using SDL. I posted the project on my github which is located at https://github.com/IUNIXI/Xbox-360-Homebrew and the project is named SDLSample.  
   
 Hopefully this will increase graphical programming for those who were waiting for SDL to become useable, including myself ^^
