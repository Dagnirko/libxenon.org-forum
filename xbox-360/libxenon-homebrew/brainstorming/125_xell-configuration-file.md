# XeLL Configuration File

## 2011-07-08 09:51:32, posted by: UNIX

I have been thinking that it might be a good idea for XeLL to check storage devices for a user defined configuration file; much like DL. looks for a launch.ini file on the root of a hard disk. This way, users can define their network configuration, filenames, visuals, etc to fit their preferences. If no configuration is defined, then use default values.   
   
 Just a thought I figured I would share. If this is already being worked on, or isn't and seems like a good idea, I would love to help :)
