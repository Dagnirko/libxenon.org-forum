I was tossing around an idea of having a podcast for the latest in Libxenon based software , and of course X360 Linux.   
   
 What does anyone think of that idea?

Think that is a quite good idea in order to keep the folks and the other forums on the current status, especially since here is a lot (deep stuff) going on and probably libxenon will be the future of the 360s homebrew. To my mind it is important to include informations and the newest binaries in such a podcast. In this moment its hard for most out there to get them because sourceforge is only providing source ^^

Sounds good to me, I'd definitely tune in each week :)
