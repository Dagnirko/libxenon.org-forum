# efuse backup/manipulation program

so this could be a complete waste of time but you never know. My thought was the major thing stopping someone from downgrading kernels is the efuse set as far as i know ( i could be totally wrong) so i did a little reading on efuses as far as i can tell if M$ is just flushing the chains with 0's and writing a new fuse set why cant we? basically you would need something that could backup the current fuse set, patch all the proper info to the "exploitable" fuse set, flush the fuse chains with zeros and write/burn the patched fuse set correctly. with any luck after that you could just use donor files to generate a proper fbbuild image  
   
 like i said it could be a complete waste of time but we paid for it we should be able to run whatever kernel we want!  
   
 i am willing to start this project if it isn't already being worked on i just need someone to point me in the right direction any information you guys could give me would be fantastic thanks for your time

I am willing to close this thread now  
   
 1. You cannot reprogram the efuses  
 2. NO rebooter-talk allowed here!
