# Sega Saturn emulator for Xell

Hi guys, what are the odds of building a Saturn emulator to run on Xell? I want to give my input as well, but I have 0 coding experience. I reckon a Saturn emulator would take the cake.

there is http://wiibrew.org/wiki/Yabause\_Wii, it can be a good start, but don't know if it will run at full speed

Cheers, but thats for Wii. What about for the 360?

i believe the point is, if you think it would be good on 360, port it?

A [url=http://code.google.com/p/nulldc/]NULLDC[/url] port or [url=http://residual.sourceforge.net/]Residual[/url] port, would be better xDDDDDD
