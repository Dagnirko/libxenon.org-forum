# xell and fatx and linux

is xell able to read fatx partitions and boot from them?  
 reason im asking is that id like to install linux but not modify the file structures of the internalhdd and install via an initial ram disk method to boot a read write linux image if possible running on the fatx partition.  
   
 can this be done?  
 it is sort of getting outside the realms of my abilities on this one.

the xbox uses xtaf, and as of now, this is not possible to my knowledge.
