# Xell Reloaded/Reset Glitch

## 2011-09-15 04:02:59, posted by: hillridge

After setting up the glitch hack on a zephyr board and attempting to boot Xell Reloaded, I get the good ring of light on startup, but no video output. Does it have to be hooked up a specific way (VGA, Component, HDMI)? Should I get the green ring of light if the hack was failing?  
   
 Thanks

Did some more testing and it works perfect on a VGA cable hooked up to a projector. Also works on a composite video cable. Still isn't working on a standard component cable set to either TV or HDTV.
