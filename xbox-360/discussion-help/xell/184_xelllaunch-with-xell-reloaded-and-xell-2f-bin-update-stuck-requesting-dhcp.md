# XellLaunch with Xell Reloaded and xell-2f.bin update stuck. (requesting dhcp)

Hi, I'm new here, and hoping for some help.  
 I'm trying to get Mupens N64 emulator working, and in order to boot it, I need Xell Reloaded to work properly.  
 So I downloaded and installed XellLaunch. Then downloaded " xell-reloaded-2stage-2011-09-23.rar (141.95 kB )", extracted it, renamed xell-2f.bin to xell.bin and put it in the XellLaunch directory.  
   
 Then I copied the XellLaunch folder to my Falcon JTAG and booted it through the FSD2a File Browser.  
 It boots. It says Xell Reloaded with huge letters. Then it does some operations. But it gets stuck on "requesting dhcp.."  
   
 Any ideas why? I've never had any problems with my network. FSD doesn't have any problems with it when downloading TUs or graphical art. And the NXE mediaplayer streams perfectly over my LAN.  
   
 When I boot my Xbox with my eject button, XeLL boots. It does allot more operations than XeLL Reloaded does before it stops on "requesting dhcp".
