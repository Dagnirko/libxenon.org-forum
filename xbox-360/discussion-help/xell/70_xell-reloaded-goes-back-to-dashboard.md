## 2011-04-25 22:50:21, posted by: wkdw1ll1ams

when i boot default.xex it returns me to the dashboard. no matter how many times i try. i have all the files in the correct place.  
   
 E:ubuntuxenon.elf  
 E:ubuntucasper  
 E:xelllaunchdefault.xex  
 E:xelllaunchxell.bin  
   
 i have a falcon freeboot 12625.  
   
 i extract xell-2f from the xell reloaded folder if this is correct?  
   
 im not sure if im meant to post this here.

my usb stick has the following root fs:  
   
 /casper/  
 /xenon.elf  
 /xellLaunch/default.xex  
 /xellLaunch/xell.bin  
   
 and all works fine.   
   
 Also please note that I'm using XeLL-Launch from DashLaunch 2.21 w/ fbBuild 0.4 w/ 12611 kernel.

You need your files in the root directory of a fat32 formatted usb drive.

 You need xell.bin in the root of your usb stick along with the xenon.elf
