# XELL / XELL RELOADED OVERSCAN HDMI

## 2011-08-25 15:20:47, posted by: silversid

Hi all.  
   
 **[b]Setup, - Falcon, Alt SMC Aud Clamp and DVD tray. Freeboot image created with latest version of coolshrimps jtag tool and selected the Xell with HDMI option. Running xell launch from the latest version of dashlaunch v2.21 running from a usb stick.[/b]**  
   
 I am having problems with overscan via HDMI when using Xell and xelllaunch.  
   
 I have added the xell reloaded file into xelllaunch and still I have overscan.   
   
 I saw a post Topic: Overscan on HDMI fixed! http://libxenon.org/http://libxenon.org//viewtopic.php?t=6 but the link no longer works.  
   
 Am I missing something? Is there a newer version of xell reloaded to get the picture to fit the screen.  
   
 Any help or direction greatly received.  
   
   
 Kind regards,

 ================================================  
 Update.  
   
 I have now updated to the latest version for Dash Launch and using the xelllaunch from that. I'm using the newest version of xell reloaded xell-2f.bin (renamed to xell.bin). Still overscan.  
   
 I have tried using component cables and HDMI, using Xell HDMI/Xell reloaded and i even flashed Xellous (to use over component) and still overscan.  
   
 I would love to get this working. I do not know a lot about linux, but would it be possible for me to compile my own version of xell reloaded and adjust the resolution to compensate for the loss of screen.  
   
   
 Lol. It wouldn't be soo bad but all the menu's and icons etc in ubuntu/gentoo are just out of sight.  
   
   
   
 Any thoughts/ideas/suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  
   
   
 Kind regards,  
   
   
 Sid
