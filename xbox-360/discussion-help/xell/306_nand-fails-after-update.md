# nand fails after update

Hi  
   
 After flashing the last xell+dashboard (through 360 multibuilder (.93) generated nand) on my falcon I got this error code when initializing nand en xell:  
   
 !SFCX: Unknown error at address 00FC200: 00000220  
   
 And when trying to flah with rawfalsh v4 i got bad block errors from address 0x0384 (more or less) and above  
   
 Is it recommended to use another rawflash version that not check this bad blocks and flash anyway?  
   
 Thanks and regards
