Hi there,  
   
 I was just reading the readme for the new xell and i read the below:  
   
 HOW TO USE  
 ==============  
   
 XeLL Reloaded checks for ELF/UpdXeLL/Kboot-config or updflash.bin in the following order:  
   
 USB (FAT/EXT2FS)  
 DVD(ISO9660)  
 HDD([color=red]XTAF[/color]/FAT/EXT2FS):  
   
 does this mean we may now run an initrd/ loop file system off a fatx/xtaf partation?  
 so we can now have linux installed and boot from an xbox formatted partition ?
