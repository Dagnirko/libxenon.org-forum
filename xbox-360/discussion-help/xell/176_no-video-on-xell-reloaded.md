alright so here is my problem when i hook my xbox up in the living room to my tv i get no video. the tv i have is a semi new one it isn't an hdmi just 480p and i have it hooked up threw the component cables(i hook up the stand rca cables and it worked fine) but to figure out why this was happening i decided to run the xell no video troubleshooting bins the component 2f garbled my video so i tried composite 2f and got it to boot it stops at the xell reloaded top screen(not sure if that is normal but yeah) above it was this   
   
 xenos fb with 78x29 (640x480) 800000001E0000006  
   
 not sure if that will help in the re-adding of my av pack info but i would love to use my bigger tv with xell reloaded(never had this problem with xellous or xell)  
   
 oh about my xbox incase you guys need to know  
   
 it's a falcon running the kk hack  
 most current xell reloaded (from GliGli's git hub)  
 the av cable i am using is the component cable that comes with the us elite xbox 360  
   
 thanks for any help or updates to fix this

 ^ that doesn't tell us what we would need to know. We would need the line that says "please report this avpack ID xx".  
   
 But also, we would need the avpack ID of the cable you are trying to to use. In other words if composite already works, running the composite troubleshooter just gives us the avpack id for your cable, which is already assigned in the list. These are specific to the cables, not the xbox.  
   
 If you're trying to use component, the minimum resolution is 720p, and your TV doesn't support a 720p signal.   
   
 My advice would be perhaps just use the standard composite cable that works as your tv doesn't support a higher resolution.

im sorry i need to correct myself composite has only worked with xell troubleshooting not xell reloaded my tv labels the composite connection component ... should i be running the 1f or the 2f? because 2f stops at the xell reloaded top screen
