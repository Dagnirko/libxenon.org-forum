# Mupen64 question

## 2013-02-17 23:04:33, posted by: stimp34

I tried to boot up mupen64 both versions that are out (.96 & .992 beta). And xell finds it off my flash drive but once it finds it, it tries to boot it and nothing happens. It is just a black screen, no signal anymore to my tv. The xbox stays on. The files are on the root. Any help will be greatly appreciated. Its a corona v3 with a tx cr3 lite and tx demon. Thanks.
