# Can't Load Any Homebrew xenon.elf's

## 2012-03-04 18:24:18, posted by: mossbreaker

I have a RGH falcon with Xell Reloaded 0.991. I have been able to run the mupen 64 .elf without any trouble. Everything else I have tried just freezes. This includes PCSXR-Xenon, ZLX Browser, Xmenu, SDLQuake, and Pong. When I try to run a .elf, it is found and then gets stuck at Executing. If I run from Xell Launcher, they get stuck at *Please wait a moment while the kernel loads... I have tried the releases of the applications and some I have compiled as well.  
   
 I was initially on Xell Reloaded 0.99, and no homebrew .elfs I tried would run at all. I tried to update but was met with errors and so I reflashed my NAND (built with xebuild, dash 14699) which included the newer Xell Reloaded. The update allowed mupen 64 to finally work, but that was all. I have tried a few different USB sticks and completely formatted them, and tried unplugging all other USB hardware. Any ideas?

 Use a smaller hard disk drive, and format it with fat32format
