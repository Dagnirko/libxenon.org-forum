# mplayer not working with xell reloaded 0.993

Hi there I have tried mplayer with the new xell reloaded 0.993 and i can no longer get it to boot.  
 i have reverted xell version and it works.  
   
 it seems to sit at the splash screen, but during it flashes up with a red screen.  
 I guess it a guru mediation screen?  
   
 Would this possibly just need to be compiled with the new tool chain and would fix it as well as make it work with the corona consoles?

Recompiling it should fix it (once a few bugs have been fixed aswell) i've actually used XMPlayer on my corona during the testing of XeLL-Reloaded v0.992/v0.993 :)

i was just looking at git hub and noticed recent commits.  
 cheers for the new binary.  
   
 so it was just hanging up mounting the attached devices on startup hdd etc...?  
   
 ill just give it a try and let you know how it goes.
