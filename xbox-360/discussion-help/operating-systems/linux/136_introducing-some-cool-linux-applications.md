# Introducing some cool Linux Applications

Hey,  
   
 I would like to present you two nice Linux applications  
   
 1. Xboxdrv  
   
 Xboxdrv is a nice Xbo360 Controller driver, which can also handle wireless controllers. With it you can even use the Controller as a mouse or keyboard replacement.  
   
 You can find the powerpc deb packages (built on ubuntu, should work the same on debian) at: http://file.libxenon.org/free60/linux/driver/xboxdrv/  
   
 2. Xboxburner  
   
 Maybe not useful for everybody, should be presented though. Xboxburner is a GUI for for restoring 0800 backups on Linux. Hook up an USB Dvd burner to your xbox and burn with it
