Im planning to buy a bluetooth keyboard and mouse for the 360, the adapter works with ubuntu (x86) out of the box. will it work with the 360 version too? anyone tried something like this yet? i know i probably wont work with the current live cds because they lack the configuration tools, but maybe those will be added in the future..

I know the mint repositories have bluetooth tools, as i removed them from the install script to save space, if you use a hdd install you can add them back from the package manager just search for blue, let us know how it goes :)

My wireless Keyboard and mouse work fine. It is similar to the Cordless-Desktop-EX100 for $25 on amazon.com.  
 I can recommend this one, but it`s not bluetooth.
