Before I post this I just want to say I really do appreciate all the hard work you guys do, I am happy to help beta test...I don't just want you to think I am complaining all the time!! :D :D :D  
   
 I've attached a screenshot of my Gnome Debian 6 install. A lot of images seem to have a yellow around them, looks like it could be to do with GIF transparency not working correctly, maybe a problem with the xenosfb driver? I Might have made a mistake??

 EDIT: Just when I thought it was GIF images, the PNG image I have just attached is also yellow :D :D :D

Just to confirm despite the picture above showing all yellow, it is actually only images that appear yellow, but the colour is the same :)

That's interesting, do we get that in all the distro's?

I noticed this too on the latest ubuntu live CD 10.10 beta... tho only very few small picture elements of webpages where yellow...   
 For example the small squares on googlemail, where you mark the mails for deletion where yellow... tho nothing else on this page.

I have this tint on all my SDL games. As well as icons in the fluxbox menu. Using latest sid debian with latest xenosfb I could find.
