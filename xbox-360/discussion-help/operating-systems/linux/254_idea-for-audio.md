hello, what about using an inexpensive usb audio adapter like this?

 what remains for a full desktop? missing gpu drivers?

yea we used them back in the day i'm talking about Kingkong shader exploit..  
   
 but there is an audio driver now.. (maybe not for hdmi..) but normal audio works.. i have the kernel for it somewhere. Was posted ages ago!
