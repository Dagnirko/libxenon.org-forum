# Advantages of Linux on 360? Mugen, Emus, Web browsing?

## 2011-08-10 06:55:37, posted by: bigdave629

I had a few questions  
 1. Is their anyway to run Linmugen through one of the boot cds?  
 2. Can mugen or emulators be run through linux at this state?  
 3. What are the advantages of running Linux on the 360, and I can still keep FSD and my games on the harddrive and linux through usb?

Hi bigdave629,  
   
   
 i dont understand very much about linux in general but i think i can answer your number 3 at least one segment of it:  
   
 If you want to permanently install linux on your 360 (HDD) you wont be able (as far is i know) to use THIS hdd in any other way. Meaning you have to swap HDDs depending on what you are going to do.  
   
 hope someone will correct me if this is wrong.  
   
 I wanted to use my 360 as a desktop replacement but a many people told me NOT to do it. For several reasons...

Not entirely true peet, BigDave you can run a livecd from your dvd drive and try it out and see if you find it beneficial. Or use a usb stick. If it's useful or not is up to you.

you can also run FSD and linux from the same usb stick... you just need to play around with launch.ini (dashlaunch settings) and voila :))

Thanks for the replies, I think I will try it out. I will put the files on a usb stick and see if I like it. Is sound still an issue and can I use my 360 controller or just a keyboard? And will I be able to leave my hard drive with FSD still plugged up while I boot off usb stick?

you can use a USB keyboard and mouse if you'd like. I don't think leaving your hard disk on is a problem but you may want to detatch it just to be sure nothing even could happen.

1 more thing. I have a Jasper with Xellous, will I have any problems with the Unbuntu Live Cd or any others?

i dont exactly understand what you mean by "will I have any problems"...  
   
 but considering it being a LIVE! CD you can expect no changes on your console, if this is your fear?!  
   
 i dont know if xellous already supports hdmi output. if not, you could first use xelllaunch (it's part of dashlaunch) to start xellreloaded and from there you boot into linux.  
 this would maybe give you hdmi output.  
   
 but if xellous supports hdmi, forget what i said...
