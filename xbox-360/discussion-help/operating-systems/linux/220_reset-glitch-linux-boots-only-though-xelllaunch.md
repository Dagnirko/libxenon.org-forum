Hello! I have a reset glitched box with ggbuild installed. Xell executes everything fine (tried sdl quake, mupen64 etc), except linux live cd's - it freezes on "Executing...". But if i'll load the same version of xell through xellLaunch then linux boots OK. Please, help!

Make sure you have the latest Xell Reloaded 0.991
