2 questions in 1- first being is there ANY way to get sun Java installed anymore? I have 7.10 installed on my Xbox and use it as my main computer (I like the debugging aspect) but no matter how far I look I cant find any working way to install sun Java- due to dependencies being removed from the servers and such, and also I'd like to be able to update my Linux to at least 10.10 but have no idea how to port the xserver, im currently learning all I can about the Xbox architecture but if anyone has any sources or scripts or anything to install or upgrade my distro please let me know, this is driving me crazy

Hey man.  
   
 The best way is to install from scratch 11.10 or 10.10 beta, i'm trying it too, keep you posted
