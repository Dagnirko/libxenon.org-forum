Hi everybody.  
 I would like to try something and I need your help. Could someone of you who have Linux installed on HDD make a backup of the whole filesystem and upload here (or somewhere else) so I could copy it to my internal HDD and launch?!

 You have to edit kboot.conf most likely to fit your configuration. And compile latest xell from branch: tuxuser .. to have native ext2fs support ;)
