# XBMC for Xbox360 on native linux

Hi,  
   
 I'm posting this here because this is where I've gotten most of my information to make this possible.  
 I realize this site is not too active these days but maybe someone might take an interest - who knows!  
   
 I've done this mostly for fun and to learn some Linux along the way.  
   
 A short run down - XBMC 11.0 (Eden) - everything works as stated - keep in mind software rendering only.  
 I've compiled 13.0 (Gotham) from source and the GUI works but as soon as I go to a video folder it core dumps.  
 14.0 Kodi boots briefly for a second and then core dumps.
