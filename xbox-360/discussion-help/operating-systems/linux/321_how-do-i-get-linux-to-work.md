# How do I get linux to work?

I've downloaded 10.10 beta 5, extracted the ISO and put it on a USB stick. Then I got a vmlinux for 2.6.36.4 which is supposed to fix the overscan, but it gives me a kernel panic because it's looking for 2.6.36.4 files.. the 10.10 beta 5's filesystem.squashfs is 2.6.36.2.  
   
 Where can I get an updated version of Ubuntu for 2.6.36.4?
