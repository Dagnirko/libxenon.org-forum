Hi,  
   
 I don't get chance to visit the community that often. I noticed the community a few months back got a bit of momentum but it's been quiet of late, I am not complaining as I don't have the skills to push forward the development...  
   
 I am just keen to know if progress is still ongoing with Ubuntu and how Xell development is going.  
   
 Thanks, Chris.

Hi,  
 Yeah you are right about it getting quiet lately on Linux. We have only one guy workin on Audio & Graphics... and imho its not worth it pushing out another release before that is accomplished.  
 Most members are busy with improving LibXenon in general.  
 XeLL Development is also still in progress. We didnt stop, dont worry.

Thanks Tux, it's reassuring to know the community is still alive and well ;D  
   
 Can't wait to see developments in the coming months.
