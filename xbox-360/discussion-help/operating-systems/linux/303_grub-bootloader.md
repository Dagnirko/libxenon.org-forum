# GRUB Bootloader?

## 2012-03-17 17:09:55, posted by: Doolster

This may sound stupid, but does the Ubuntu distro come with the GRUB bootloader, and will I be able to install Ubuntu alongside the standard X360 OS, to play normal games on?  
 Basically will I still be able to connect to xbox live, play games, etc.

That is extremely unhelpful since every search i can think of to answer this question keeps leading me here. A simple yes or no would be appropriate. Thank you  
   
 Edit: i know ubuntu comes with grub 2 but does it work on the 360?

So maybe I am wrong, the point I am trying to reference is the same

much of grub is platform dependent, so it requires being ported to each specific architecture. Unfortunately there is no PowerPC port of grub yet, and I highly doubt there will be one in the near future.

What sk1080 is trying to say i think is no, it will not dual boot like that

Xell can load a boot menu similar to LILO style config  
   
 EDIT: or maybe more like isolinux, most similar to ps3 asbestos

So it can dual boot to the stock os?

We don't really talk about the stock os here, but in short it is as simple as pressing a different button to start it up  
   
 This forum is for Libxenon and Linux on the 360, which can co-exist with other methods that we don't like to talk about  
   
 I seriously suggest you read up on the existing 360s hacks and implementation, any tutorial out there should explain everything you need to know
