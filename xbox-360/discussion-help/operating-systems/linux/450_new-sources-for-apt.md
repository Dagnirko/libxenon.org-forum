Hello people of LibXenon  
   
 I wanted to make an little download server of my old xbox 360.  
 I was using the live ubuntu 10.10 but its kinda outdated and i cant for instance install samba and proftpd and transmission.  
   
 Do you have a solution with a more updated distribution or an updated sources.list  
   
 Thanks for your help:)
