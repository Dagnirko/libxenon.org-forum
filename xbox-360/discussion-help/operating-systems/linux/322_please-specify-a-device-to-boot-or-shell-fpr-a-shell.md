I keep getting this error when trying to boot linux via usb.  
 also says The root block device is unspecified or not detected.

that's not much info to go from, what linux exactly is on your usb, what kernel, are you using kboot.conf, if so what is the line your using to start the kernel, if not paste your kernel config line
