# Any help with Mugen through Linux live cd?

## 2011-12-04 08:20:24, posted by: bigdave629

I have not to much Linux knowledge and instead of messing something up I thought I would ask here first. I got the Ubuntu Live cd from the other forum and wanted to know instead of it going to the desktop can I make only boot 1 program Linmugen or Jmugen without it installing anything on the hard drive with 360 controller drivers. Can anyone help me understand what to do or where to start, I know to work mugen even linmugen on the xbox but my knowledge of linux is limited and this seems like the only option to get a program I like on the 360.
