I just registered this evening after a search on xbox-scene, not new to xbox's as i have been modding xbox1's and now jtagging and repairing 360's.  
 Now i am a big fan of xbmc and use it everday on my old xbox and thought i would look here for a linux variant that could possibly run xbmc, i have read a few posts about xell but i think its not quite the same version as used on a jtagged 360.   
 I dont really need a desktop enviroment but would like wifi/usb/streaming support and the ability to access an internal sata hdd and remote support so a recomendation to which version of linux will suit this would be appreciated.

Hi,  
   
 I would suggest checking out free60.org as this lists current available distributions. Additionally you can view the linux section on this site and test the Linux Mint LXDE.  
   
 Personally having tried every variant that has been made public on both free60.org and here the Ubuntu 10.10 BETA 5 ISO is your best bet. It cannot be installed as yet, and sound does not work (this is the case with every distribution) however via USB it loads very quick and spin locking seems less obvious than previous distributions I have tried (likely down to the kernel compile / the lightweight LXDE interface).  
   
 XBMC is a no go at the moment from what I know, I have seen a youtube video many years ago of it booting on the 360 but this was on Ubuntu 7.10.  
   
 Your best bet if you are looking for some kind of media player is to either wait until FSD Incorporates one in to their dash (not too long away by the looks of things).  
   
 Wifi is on the latest kernel 2.6.36.4 build, although it is not included as default on the BETA 5 ISO, so you will need to download that separately.  
   
 Best regards,  
 Chris.
