it depends what you want.  
   
 minimal installs will always be quick, but will not have a desktop environment.  
   
 I think that you are asking though is what is fastest distro with desktop environment.  
   
 Boot speed wise there is not much in it, but for speed once loaded I would have to say Linux Mint Debian Edition because it uses the LXDE desktop environment.  
   
 I currently use Debian Squeeze with Gnome and this is fast enough for me, especially via Xell Launch.

You can try atleast... the open source of flash is called "gnash"... theres no adobe flash plugin for powerpc.. so you have to try that alternative.
