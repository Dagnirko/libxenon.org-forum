# install moon os or another linux

I'd like to know if it is possible to install moon os for example on 360?  
 i'm looking in ubuntuinstall.sh and debianinstall.sh to understand how and if it's possible to build one by myself!  
 in fact at the moment i'm looking about debootstrap*.deb! i understood that moon os wes made from xubuntu or near, so seems to me to be a debian distribution, and as far as i understand needs a debootstrap*deb? how to build one? or find one?  
 ambitious? yes! i want to try, that's my way learning! ;)  
   
 i have an iso of it, so is it necessary to use ftp connection to download etc etc?

i think moon os is currently X86 only, you need a PPC compatible distro

mmh well!  
 i don't know much about x86 etc. i was looking for 64 bits distribution, i forgot the "ppc" detail!  
 well to be short, i just want to learn on how making my self distribution if that is possible!  
 i'm very curious and i want to work on linux step by step!  
 i find everywhere but that not so simple ;) i guess

 If you're interested in making your own distro, you can try Linux From Scratch. As far as I know there is a PPC derivative you can use. See here:
