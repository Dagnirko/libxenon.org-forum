# Linux from NAND[Moved]

Accidentally posted this under Linux downloads the first time... My mistake, tired ;P  
   
 OP:  
 Would it be possible to run Linux from the NAND flash? If you were to cross compile the Linux kernel and flash it to the NAND, what would happen? Just curious, and I think it would be really cool, and maybe open up a few possibilities.. Thanks.

Linux Kernel could be run from the NAND, yup. For the RootFS, rather not as NAND is too small and not really worth it to screw the flash up.  
   
 PS: Why are you askin in here, you know I am planning it :P

Hmm, I may solder a flasher back to my box and give it some testing.   
   
 Ps. Didn't know you were working on it :P
