Just wondering what the latest stable full version Linux distro for Phat Xbox360 is?  
   
 Free60 lists Ubuntu 11.10 but the Oneiric install script lists debootstrap debian 038 which seems to no longer be hosted anywhere...  
   
 Free60 Squeeze install script also includes same 038 file.  
   
 Other users reference Ubuntu 13.04...  
   
 Looking to install Linux but cant get a working version as yet hence question.  
   
 Cheers
