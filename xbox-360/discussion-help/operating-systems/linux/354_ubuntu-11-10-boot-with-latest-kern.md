Hey guys, I hope this isn't too much of a noob question but I'm just a little unsure what I have to do with the "Latest\_Kern" file. I know it has to be made into a live CD or USB but I have no idea how to accomplish this. Not to mention the Kboot.conf that I also need to change or add. Apart from this issue I have Ubuntu 11.10 installed on my HDD, I just need to boot into it :D
