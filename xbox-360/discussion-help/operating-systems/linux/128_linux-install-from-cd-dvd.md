Maybe my question is a little weird, but why don't make an installable Linux for Xbox 360 from CD/DVD? Is it impossible?

I know it would be possible with the Ubuntu installer 'Ubiquity' which is a graphical installer for Ubuntu. I am going to experiment with making a LiveCD with Ubiquity soon. As long as the system in selected to install on SDA2, there shouldn't be a problem.

This will be just fine, because I can't manage to get a dhcp offer on Xbox 360 from my Desktop running Ubuntu 9.04 with dhcp3-server installed and configured In many ways. Or maybe I do something wrong and there should be some special settings in dhcpd.conf file?
