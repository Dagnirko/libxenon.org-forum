# Loopback file

Just a thought here. I'm sure this has been debated already. I can't remember exactly what and where. But will we ever be able to boot linux the way we used to on our old xbox1 console? And i mean why not create a loopback file so linux can be on the harddisk with the rest of the xbox360 files.   
   
 I believe i've read something in the past about the fatx file system. Does it have 4gb max file size or something.....?? I believe it does huh. Might be harsh on the linux distro.

Yeah the 4GB Limit exists on XTAF still :( :( :(   
 Also I have to admit that I am lacking the skills to port the [url=http://file.libxenon.org/free60/linux/driver/freebsd\_xtaf\_module.zip]BSD Drivers[/url] for XTAF to Linux..  
 If anybody is advanced enough to do it I would really like to hear from you, thx!  
   
 And yeah, once this is done the loopback thing won't be a problem cause we could split the loopback file in 4GB parts iirc.
