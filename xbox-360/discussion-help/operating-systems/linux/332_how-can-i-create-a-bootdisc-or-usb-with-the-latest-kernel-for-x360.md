That's my nigthmare.  
   
 I've successfully installed ubuntu 7.10 in my Xbox360 and i want to use the latest kernel, that i suppose it's better than the one fitted into Xell SDA2 iso disc.  
   
 How can i made it? I've searched for a couple of hours and nothing... seriously nothing.  
   
 Cheers.
