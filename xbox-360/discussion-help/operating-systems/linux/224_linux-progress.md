Hi to everyone,  
 I'm aware that this post could seems a bit arrogant but it's not; I'm posting for ask if there are any progress for what lead me far from linux on my xbox360: I can't boot it straight from the hdd with a double partition w/ ms dashboard, are there any progress?  
   
 I would also thanks everyone involved in xell-reloaded and all the great jumps done as now, thanks for your hard works!
