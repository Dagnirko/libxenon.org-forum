# LibXenon FreeBSD Port

## 2012-01-07 01:36:35, posted by: UNIX

Hello everyone,  
 I apologize for my hiatus in recent months, but I am now back and will be resuming work with LibXenon. I have started the process of porting LibXenon to FreeBSD, as currently LibXenon is optimized for Linux installations via shell script. Hopefully when I am finished with the porting process, and have tested the port fully and see that it is working, I will submit it to [url=http://www.freebsd.org/ports/]the FreeBSD Ports Tree[/url], so that LibXenon can become a part of it.   
   
 I have re-setup [url=https://github.com/IUNIXI]my GIT repository[/url] and have already started to begin the porting of LibXenon to FreeBSD at [url=https://github.com/IUNIXI/FreeBSD-LibXenon-Port]https://github.com/IUNIXI/FreeBSD-LibXenon-Port[/url].
