# [BUGREPORTING] XMPlayer

## 2013-09-13 22:22:29, posted by: siz

This thread is for bugreporting XMPlayer, not for providing support :P  
   
 Always start by checking "Known Issues" in Readme on the repo: https://github.com/LibXenonProject/xmplayer, also look under "Issues" on that page to see if it's already fixed for next release. Please always post your bug report if you get a Red Screen, even if the bug is known.   
   
 If you already have a **[b]github user[/b]**, it would be great if you could start a "Issue" if it's a unknown bug, or just comment a known "Issue".
