# Question about LPT cable

I've made that LPT cable to program the xilinx microcontroller and noticed that it outputs 4.2V, not 3.3V like in schematics. I suppose this is why we need to use external 3.3V power supply?  
   
 I have two questions:  
 1. Does that mean that cable can be simplified by not soldering Vcc and GND wires (using 4 wires + 2 from external power source instead of 6)?  
 2. Maybe we could use those 6 wires together with 3.3V voltage regulator and a couple of capacitors to make that external power supply unnecessary?
