# Jasper 512 cb 6751 glitch experience

## 2011-11-06 15:49:35, posted by: rockla

I found that my console has cb 6751 and people are suggesting to use donor nand of 6750 so has anyone done it? Since someone tried it and it resulted in frequent reboots and unstable console and haven't seen anyone glitched 6751 successfully  
   
 Any assistance would be grateful

Ok the console is glitched but glitch timings are way too high what all things could be wrong?
