# Matrix Glitcher: does it work for you on slim (trinity) ?

Hi there,  
   
 i'm wondering if someone had some succes with the matrix glitcher on slim's motherboard. I saw a few people on iRC having problem, and of course i have some problem too. I did get the matrix to boot the exploit two times only (that's better than nothing) on more than 50 try with the 270pF modification diagram sent to me by the matrix team : http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/18/testcapacitor2.jpg/  
 Of couse i did (re)wire everything a lot of time, i'm 99% sure of my soldering, i did check vcc etc ...  
   
 I think it could be great to share our (non)success with that to see if the problem comes from the chip itself.  
 Thanks for your reports!

Little update: i did install a new glitch chip (x360glitch) and it's working fine now.

I tried to use it here, but it did not work on Xbox 360 slim. I checked and I'm sure the welds, 99%, that all is well. I did the layout of the capacitor. I will try and post here.
