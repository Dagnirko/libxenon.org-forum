I have 2 and both won't glitch even with a xecuter coolrunner and the extra line of code in build.py.

Just run it through any of the current ecc builders out there and it should generate a log file. Paste it here.

I did a Zephyr with 1.10 SMC at the weekend. Used a TX Coolrunner and it reliably boots in 5-10s each time.
