# Falcon reset glitch hangs on glitching

## 2011-10-23 16:55:28, posted by: djblade17

30-1 minute it takes to glitch my consoles or it wont even glitch at all  
 dash 13146 the one where only 1 ldv is there the other is blank(dont know if this matters)  
 Stock Matrix glitcher  
 I have 2 other falcons that glitch fine  
 I am using a alternate b points( the one thats used for post readout) I ripped my first one I think  
 Altho i can get the wire to stick there no problem I thought this would be my issues so I tested the alt and the same thing  
   
 I am using gliglig 1.1 build with falcon support  
 1/5 times it will succeed   
 If i build with ggbuild it wont work at all sits there blinking center light then eventually goes to rrod   
 Comments suggestions?  
   
 For creating gg build i needed to use flash360 to extract the extra files needed  
 While on the first 2 falcons i did not need too  
   
   
 I also have a usb uart ttl cable if needed?
