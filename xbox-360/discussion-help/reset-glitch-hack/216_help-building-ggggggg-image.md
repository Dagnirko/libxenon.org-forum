Python is not working on my PC for some reason I was wondering if anyone would help build the image? After installing it and changing the enviroment with PYTHONPATH it will not execute and says python is not recognized as a command.

 Thanks that fixed the problem. 1 More question it is telling me I need to enter the 1bl key properly I have it like this "\xAA\xBB\xCC\xDD\xEE\xFF\x11\x22\x33\x44\x55\x66\x77\x88\x99\x00" is that not correct?  
   
 edit by tuxuser: Removed the real 1BL Key
