Instead of using the point next to the HANA chip for the STBY\_CLK can we just use the FT2R2 point first? Seems to be the safer way to go rather than accidentally bridging other points.

 It is stated in http://libxenon.org/http://libxenon.org//viewtopic.php?t=9 that it is an alternate point to use but I wanna be certain before I start using it?
