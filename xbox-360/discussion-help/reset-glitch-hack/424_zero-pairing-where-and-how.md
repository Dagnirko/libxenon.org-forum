Hi, i'm a new entry in this forum and i'm starting to study the RGH in all its components, but i've some doubts about zero pairing:  
 I've heard that's used to enter in MFG mode and launch BLs without knowing CPUKey, but i can't understand the dynamic of the facts.  
 On FAT consoles the CB is zero paired.Why?it's because we have to launch CD(xell) without knowing the CPUKey?  
   
 Thanks! :)
