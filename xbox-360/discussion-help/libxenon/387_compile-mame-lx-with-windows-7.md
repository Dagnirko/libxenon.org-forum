I would suggest setting up a dual boot pc on your pc, one for windows and the other for linux. Then set libxenon up on linux. I have had nothing but trouble trying to get it setup on windows and linux is ALOT easier to use with libxenon. Here http://libxenon.org/http://libxenon.org//viewtopic.php?t=2&nbsp; is a great tut for setting it up under linux.

ced why mame is slow becouse hardware can bear to mame requirement  
 maybe some code cleanup or  
 the ram is the problem,  
 maybe we could try to copile a mame without chd,with only originals  
 and limited to year  
 exmp; roms from 1988-beyond  
 these are my thought i dont know damn thing

no hardware is under mame requirement :s cpu is too slow only old version of mame can run neogeo cps1/cps2 at fullspeed (before 0.120)
