I've been trying to record video off my xbox to VCR/DVD Recorder, but I'm getting a E25 (copying program not allowed) or something to that nature, the video also was not playing in the stock video player, but did play on XMplayer but wont allow me to record, I googled XMPlayer and Macrovision and came across something about it..  
   
 How can I get Macrovision disabled on XMPlayer?
