[align=center]Hey Guys!! Im new to the this site and introducing myself :)  
 Also ive been thinking about making a libxenon game/whatever and dont really know anything about it!!  
 What would be a good place to start?  
 Who made libxenon?  
 When was it made?  
 How does it work?  
 Are There other things like it?  
 Is it just a library of offsets and values so you dont have to find them?  
   
 If anyone could anwser these questions I would very much appreciate it! 8)[/align]

First of all you'll want to learn how to program in C/C++ it's also useful to understand how to use linux, even to have a linux system set-up for compiling...  
   
 Libxenon is made by several ppl, read the file "AUTHORS" to find out more...  
   
 It's been updated many times, i am not sure when it was first started...  
   
 Libxenon is a library used by whatever homebrew you include it in... it works like any other library ;)  
   
 Sure, there are similar projects for other consoles... but... there's no other legal homebrew library out there afaik  
   
 It's not offsets and values, it's entire code... once you understand how C/C++ works you'll have better understanding about how Libxenon works...

 I started off with C# and worked my way over to C/C++, i can't say i "know" C/C++, but i do understand it because the syntax is mostly the same as C#...  
   
 And i can tell you, i haven't studied programming anywhere... i've learnt everything i know about it online some of it by simply trying and some of it by having friends explaining things to me... but most of it has been from just trying... once you understand the syntax the rest comes quite naturally ;)
