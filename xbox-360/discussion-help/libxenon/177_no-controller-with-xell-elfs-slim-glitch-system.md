# No controller with Xell Elfs .. Slim glitch system.

## 2011-09-21 08:41:07, posted by: Juggahaxor

I got my CPLD today , installation went fine and I was glitching as soon as I finished my soldering. The other day I tried out Mupen64 on an SMC modded system, with no problems, the controller was working etc...  
   
 Now I am using the exact same controller for the Slim with the RGH, but when I get into Mupen I have no controller to select my ROM .... or anything for that matter.  
   
 I have tried with it plugged into both front USB ports , in the back USB ports , and with batteries in it as a wireless controller. I don't know if the plug and play is the issue , I am running it with no batteries when I have it plugged in.  
   
 So far so good though, I am very excited to finally have my board in and everything working, except this.

you probably need to get the latest libxenon updates and rebuild the apps you want with the latest changes for the slim HW

Same problem here, the pads synch successfully but can't stop blinking then.  
 With a fresh new install of libxenon i have rebuilded the app and everything works fine now :D

I had issues syncing as well but managed to fix it. I had to sync the controller to my other xbox first and then let the xbox boot all the way into mupen and then resync the controller and xbox. Make sure you press the buttons at the same time and not more than once.
