hello it's me again XD   
 I wonder if there is any way to test the project without being on xbox because it is annoying to have to keep calling off etc. .. etc. ...

Without an actual Xbox 360 you can't do any REAL testing on things, you'd need a Xbox 360 Emulator in order to be able to even start testing stuff without a Xbox 360... that said you could maybe use a ppc64 emulator aswell  
   
 The best way to test your homebrew projects that you are meant to run on the 360 is to well do just that, run it on the 360 ;)
