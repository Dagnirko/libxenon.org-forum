# Libxenon Install Help

What am I doing wrong here? I really am stumped and have tried googling my problem with no luck. What are LSB modules? Pretty sure the Toolchain is installed.

have you try it to install with root permitions? and did you install all libs dependences that are described on the instalation tutorial?  
   
 Try run this in terminal before installing libxenon and the others libs [code]sudo su[/code]
