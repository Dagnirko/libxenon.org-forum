Honestly, i don't think anyone will do this for you...  
   
 It's clearly only for you to be able to use it in a mod shop to know when the console finished loading XeLL...

Mumble, mumble ... you got the wrong request. Did you mean a sound more like RRRRROOOOAAAARRRR?  
 Throw away your Xboxs...there's a life out there...
