Hi all! I have a strange problem about ZLX Browser compiled by myself on a fresh libxenon toolchain installation (I have tried with master and Swizzy branch): seems only sda are recognized, uda disappear totally...but with an old compile of zlx browser, all seems to be good.  
   
 Where is the fault?
