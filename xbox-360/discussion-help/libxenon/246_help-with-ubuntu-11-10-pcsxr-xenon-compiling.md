Hello all...I'm new to Linux...but recently Jtag'd my 360 & of course d/l games & emu's...I would like to get pcsxr-xenon to work as well...all others NES, SNES, N64, GENESIS, GAMEBOY....work great....PCSXR, the elf loads but screen us garbled....I wanted to recompile the source with the updates from GIT, I have the files & the instructions to type in Terminal to compile(make $$ make install) but I can't seem to get into the dir where thf files are(Downloads) in Ubuntu 11.10 booting off USB...can someone point me in thf right direction...it's not like I'm not trying....just need a little of someone's vast knowledge of this OS that I know nothing about....I'm eager to play FF7 or 8......It would be greatly appreciated.  
   
   
   
 Also....just curious, but why wouldn't Ced2911 just compile the source with the new files and zip or 7z it to a new version?

I had problems with the current sources on the git - I talked to Ced2911 earlier and mentioned it to him, so perhaps it's something missing from the current source.

Thanks for the reply....I have all the files, but I do not know Linux to compile the new files to the source....That's what I was getting at :)  
 I made a bootable USB with Ububtu to try & learn, but not knowing a thing about Linux....this is a difficult task

Current source is not playable - gui is removed - so not intended to "work" - use the released version if you want to have compatibility.

I was under the impression the updates help some video problems...which I was experiencing, and I thought this might fix the issue by re-compiling

Just to add some more info in case someone has had the same issue: component cable with HD setting on, Xell Reloaded to launch elf, Tv is running 1080i resolution. Are any of these items an issue with Pcsxr-xenon? Am I doing something wrong? As I said, Xell Reloaded loads the .elf, but it either comes up with the screen very distorted, or either it flashes and returns back to the Xell screen and stays there.

Again, I talked to Ced2911 (it's his code) - he said the current version (what you grabbed) will not work. Perhaps if you know what you're doing, you can edit his code, but the current build is useless for users.

Ok...Well thank you GhaleonX for researching...I was just wanting to use the emulator....but oh well.
