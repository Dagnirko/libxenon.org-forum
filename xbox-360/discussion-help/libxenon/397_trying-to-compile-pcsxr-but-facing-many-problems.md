# trying to compile pcsxr but facing many problems

hello guys...first of all am total noob in compiling and coding...but found a new version of pcsxr which makes all games work but without sound...and to make it with sound a line must be changed in the maingui text file..but the app must be compiled from start...i have spent 2 days to try to compile or try to understand in linux coding or so on but each time i face new problem  
 my problem nw is when i run this command "make -f Makefile.debug" to run the file and compile the new xenon.elf it gives me this error in cygwin "« Makefile.debug:7: *** « Please set DEVKITXENON in your environment. export DEVKITXENON=devkitPPC ». Stop. »"   
 so i knew that to solve this issue u have to add two lines   
   
 export DEVKITXENON= »/usr/local/xenon »  
 export PATH= »$PATH:$DEVKITXENON/bin:$DEVKITXENON/usr/bin »  
   
 i added them manually in the text file cause i dunn have "nano" command to open file from within cygwin  
   
 so after adding them and ran makefile command i got this error  
   
 « [pasm.S]  
 [main.cpp]  
 [texture\_load\_wnd.cpp]  
 make[1]: xenon-gcc: Command not found  
 /usr/local/xenon/rules:35: recipe for target `pasm.o’ failed  
 make[1]: *** [pasm.o] Error 127  
 make[1]: *** Waiting for unfinished jobs….  
 make[1]: xenon-g++: Command not found  
 make[1]: xenon-g++: Command not found  
 /usr/local/xenon/rules:19: recipe for target `texture\_load\_wnd.o’ failed  
 make[1]: *** [texture\_load\_wnd.o] Error 127  
 /usr/local/xenon/rules:19: recipe for target `main.o’ failed  
 make[1]: *** [main.o] Error 127  
 Makefile.debug:151: recipe for target `build\_debug’ failed  
 make: *** [build\_debug] Error 2?  
   
 so i dunno what to do or what is this error....also is it necessary to run debian or put dependances in it? i mean this error has something to do with dependances not being installed on debian?
