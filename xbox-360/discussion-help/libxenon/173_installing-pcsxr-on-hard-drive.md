# installing pcsxr on hard drive?

## 2011-09-17 09:24:25, posted by: bigdave629

I wanted to know if I could install psx emu on my hard drive and use it there instead of my usb stick? Basically I just want to make sure it doesn't corrupt any thing using this with my other games. And can I have more linux emus on the same hard drive? sorry for noob question does corruption only happen with actual linux distros on same hard drive?

what do you mean hard drive corruption? pscx-r doesnt run in linux, it runs via xell, and you can put the zlx elf on a usb stick as xenon.elf along with pscx-r.elf and mupen etc, load xell with that usb stick plugged in and pick them from a menu

i wanted to know if running them from my hard drive was fine instead of usb through fsd.

i wanted to know where you got the idea something would corrupt your hdd, but it matters not.   
   
 I don't think you can run elf's from your hdd yet unless its formatted fat32, which a retail 360 hdd is not.  
   
 you know you can boot xell via the eject button as well? or use a launch.ini on a usb stick to boot straight into xelllaunch. fsd isnt a requirement for anything here.

Sorry I must have read something wrong, it was about having linux and fsd on the same drive with 2 partitions 1 for linux the other for nxe. Again sorry. I have external hard drive formatted fat32 and have most of games etc. on there and wanted to put pcsxr and other emus on there as well.

that might work, but please refrain from discussing games on the hdd, etc here.

 just to let you know, i run all of this off my external hdd but you have to use xell. so its fine to use an external hdd with the pcsxr files etc on it. Like cancerous said there is no way of doing it without using xell atm, who knows what will be released soon as i think the 360 scene has been rebooted since the gligli hack
