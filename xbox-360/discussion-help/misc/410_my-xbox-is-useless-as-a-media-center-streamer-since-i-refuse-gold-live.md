So I bounced around the intertubes for a while until I hit the sourceforge page then to free60 and here.  
   
 I'm not a programmer so I can't really help the effort except by testing out a working distro. So is anyone still using these forums? The latest posts I've seen were from Spring 2013.

 The Xbox 360 Don't have a very good media player, and unless you have RGH/JTAG you're not going to be able to solve that... once you get this hack installed you will be able to launch XMPlayer which is a better media player then the built in one, however... it still have some issues that we are working on trying to fix...
