# xenon 3.5.4 kernel wifi driver? 

## 2013-05-19 22:41:57, posted by: fentis

Is there any driver for slim wifi adapter (id 045e:0765)?  
 Enabling wireless, cfg80211, mac80211 and wireless usb extentions on kernel config, adapter is still not recognized.  
 Am I missing some configuration or there isn't actually any suitable driver?  
   
 Thanks in advance
