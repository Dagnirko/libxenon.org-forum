I'm wondering if it is this project or maybe it's already supported in the linux vanilla kernel--  
   
 "Xbox 360 hdmi converter" - this piece of hardware converter, anyone knows where i can find the source code supporting this?

we need more information on the hardware you are talking about.  
 can you give us the make, model number and any other information on the hardware you are talking about?
