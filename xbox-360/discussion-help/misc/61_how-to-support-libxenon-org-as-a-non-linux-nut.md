Even if the reply comes almost one year later, there is a way to really help us even if you aren't a coder/reverse engineerer etc.  
   
 It's about cleaning and organizing the wiki nicely!!!  
   
 If you look for example at http://wiibrew.org/wiki/Main\_Page or http://www.pshomebrew.net/wiki/Main\_Page - It has a nice layout and information is very easy to find.  
   
 Now look at http://free60.org - It doesn't look that good.  
   
 So that's how you can help:  
   
 * Link pages to each other so content is easy to find  
 * Create pages with good information  
 * Look through various pages for layout / or if they dont have a proper layout at all - correct it!  
 * Start FAQ - page  
 etc etc.  
   
 Would like to hear your opinion about it!

hmkay ...if i get some sparetime. i will have a look.  
 btw.  
 What aboout a Free60 Youtube channel?   
 Ok...i could set up a bunch of Playlists, wich you could link on Free60.org...but i'am just a Visitor to this site, not the owner.  
   
 So it would be harder for you guys to keep them updated...even so its just 1-2 klicks.  
   
 P.s.  
 i know...bad english (get over it)

TBH, a youtube channel isnt needed.  
 We would have a use for good-explained tutorials though.
