# Ride controller on PC?

## 2013-12-02 02:11:45, posted by: Newuser

Wondering if anyone here could help me out with getting a Ride Controller up and running on a PC.  
 The Ride controller is a skateboard peripheral released with a Tony Hawk game. Information seems pretty sparse because it never took off.  
   
 I have a 360 version of the controller I want to experiment with on PC, but XInput is only mapping partial information, so I can't get at the tilt/gyroscopes as far as I can tell.  
 Front and back vertical gravity is mapped to triggers, and the 4 IR sensors map to the thumbsticks.  
   
 Does anyone know of any tools that could be helpful at dumping raw information or somehow getting at the data being sent from the board, assuming it is possible for it to work with the wireless dongle..?  
 I am not too familiar with hardware/drivers etc so I am not sure how to approach this at the moment :s
