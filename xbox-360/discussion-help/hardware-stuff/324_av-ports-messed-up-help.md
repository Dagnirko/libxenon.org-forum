# av ports messed up HELP

Ok so awhile back i messed up my av port.  
 The port of the xbox is leaking from the back.... So i just let one of my friends who had a tv with hdmi use it until i got a fix. I just saw someones video which he soldered normal av cables to this thing under the xbox. Here's the video.

 So if some kind person could put up a diagram or something on how to do this it would be AWESOME!  
   
 Thx for reading!!!
