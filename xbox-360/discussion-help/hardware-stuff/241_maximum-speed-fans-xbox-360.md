Does anyone know how to increase your speed to an original Xbox 360 fan? And if by doing so you risk going to live on some flags or ban?  
 Thanks in advance.

You could simply run a wire from a 12v lead on the motherboard to the bottom of the fan header on either of the voltage leads, they are both connected to each other on the 3 pin header, but on the four pin header you would have to bridge them.  
 The attached image will show you a where a 12v lead is on the bottom of your motherboard, and if you have a three pin fan connector ground is the middle, and the outer two pins are power for each fan.  
 if you have a four pin connector the two pin holes for power look a bit rounded on the top, the square ones are ground, or brwown and red are power, blue and black are ground.  
 Soldering required, skill level: Moderate.  
 as it being undetectable by Microsoft, and how they wouldn't necessarily care if you would go through the trouble of doing this with no benefit to you besides the console running cooler and preventing the RRoD, you won't get banned for doing this.  
 hope this helps.
