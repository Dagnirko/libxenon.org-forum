# Extra USB Ports access

If you have seen [url=http://forums.xbox-scene.com/index.php?showtopic=724804]this[/url] you know that there are extra, but unusable, USB ports on the xenon motherboard. Would libxenon or linux be able to access these if I were to solder a socket to them?

good with soldering? it may be worth trying if you really want more usb ports and dont have a usb hub to use. It would be interesting to find out at the least. If you arent good with an iron don't risk your box tho.

I am pretty good with soldering, though my hardware knowledge is limited. I need to get my xenon reflowed. I was actually more curious of someone has tried.
